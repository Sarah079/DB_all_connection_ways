0. IntroDB3: These are the slides. You will find the description of the take home tasks listed at the end.

1. CUD272ClassTutorial: This is the code we wrote in class. In order to do the takeaway tasks, you will need to make changes to the connection string in order to connect to your own local db. I did not include the 'wwwroot' folder in this zip for space considerations. You can add it back yourself.

2. 272Demo18DB: This the sql script that has the schema + data we used in the last class.
